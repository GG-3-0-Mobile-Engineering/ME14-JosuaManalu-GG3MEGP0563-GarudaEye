# GarudaEye - Disaster Information App in Indonesia

## Introduction
GarudaEye App is an application that provides real-time information about disasters in Indonesia. The data used in the application is obtained from the [PetaBencana API](https://docs.petabencana.id/routes/). This application is developed using the Kotlin programming language and designed with XML.

### The Motivation behind the app
The motivation behind this app is to fulfill the final project requirement for the program I participated in, which is GIGIH 3.0 organized by GoTo Impact Foundation.

## Features
GarudaEye App provides various features that help users to get up-to-date information about disasters in Indonesia. Here are some of the available features:
1. **List of Disasters in Indonesia**: Displays a list of disasters that occurred in Indonesia within the last 2 days.
2. **Natural Disaster Filters**: Users can filter disasters based on the following types:
   - Flood
   - Earthquake
   - Strong Wind
   - Haze
   - Forest Fire
   - Volcanic Eruption
3. **Filter by Province**: Users can filter disasters based on the provinces in Indonesia.
4. **Map View**: The application displays a map showing the locations of disasters in Indonesia.
5. **Water Level Warning Notifications**: Users will receive warning notifications if the water level in a dam rises. (For now, the data for this feature is still dummy as it is empty from the API endpoint /floodgauges to get water level data in a specific region).
6. **Dark Mode Theme**: The app supports a dark mode theme for user comfort during nighttime use.
7. **Disaster Details (Coming Soon)**: Users will be able to view detailed information about disasters in the next release.
